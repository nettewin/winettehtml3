  <h2>WHAT IS RUN FOR HOPE?</h2>
  <p>Run For Hope (RFH) is an annual run jointly organised by Four Seasons Hotel Singapore and the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) to raise awareness & support for cancer research. </p>
<br>
  <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU BE A PART OF RUN FOR HOPE?</h2>
  <p>More than 10,000 people are diagnosed with cancer each year in Singapore. The disease accounts for 1 in 4 deaths in Singapore, therefore the threat of cancer is very real. With advances in science and robust cancer research activities, we are hopeful that the progressive breakthroughs made by the NCCS team can lead to a cure. <br><br>
There are many reasons for you to support the run and continue the legacy. By being a part of Run For Hope, you can show your support for cancer patients and their families, bust off daily work stress, keep fit, have fun, and make a difference with your colleagues, family and friends!<br><br>
Funds raised net operating cost will be donated to NCC Research Fund. Through your continuous support, we can make a difference in the lives of those affected. Let's make a brighter future, without cancer. </p>
